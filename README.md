# tarot-reader
Project 2 for Juno's Accelerated JS class
This minimalist tarot app allows users to choose between a single or triple card tarot spread. 

Reflecting on tarot mythology can help users gain insights into their personal circumstances as they recognize their own strengths, weaknesses, and humanity reflected in the cards. Drawing inspiration from the archetypical images and stories depicted in the Rider-Waite tarot deck, users can use their abstract thinking and pattern recognition skills to make connections between the tarot and their own lives.


This project uses the HowlCode Tarot API ( https://github.com/howlCode/tarot_api ) to populate the app with all of the tarot data. In order to create a better user experience and keep the app to a single page, a number of modals were used to hide or display the appropriate content to the user.


A simple fade animation was added to some of the modals to help create a sense of flow and evoke a calm contemplative mood. To elicit suspense, mystery, and anticipation CSS pseudo-classes and transitions were used to simulate the experience of turning over a physical card.
